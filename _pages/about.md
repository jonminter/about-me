Software engineer with over a decade of proven technical ability and leadership. Passionate about technology and continuing to learn and teach others.

Expertise in service oriented architecture/microservices, cloud engineering and blah. Currently trying to learn all I can about topics like concurrency, distributed systems and machine learning/AI.

When I'm not in front of of a computer screen you can find me out for run or a hike, in the rock climbing gym or doing some traveling.
